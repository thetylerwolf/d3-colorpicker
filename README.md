d3-colorpicker
==============

A reusable color picker built using d3.js. Currently supports HSL color space only, but RGB is in the works.

See the example for the simplest possible implementation. Slider bar sizes and example box size are customizable via accessor functions on the colorpicker object:

ex.) colorpicker.boxSize(100)
